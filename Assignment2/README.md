# Assignment 2

## Objective
The objective of this assignment was to find a testbench of the vhdl model we found in assignment 1 and create a value change dump (VCD) of this file and analyze it in GTKWave.


### [Original Model](https://github.com/Jonathan-Cho/CPE-487/blob/main/Assignment2/fsm_counter.vhdl)
*Used in assignment 1*


### [Test Bench](https://github.com/Jonathan-Cho/CPE-487/blob/main/Assignment2/tb_fsm_counter.vhdl)
*I had originally submitted this for assignment 1, however this is the test bench of the original modeal*


### [VCD File](https://github.com/Jonathan-Cho/CPE-487/blob/main/Assignment2/fsm_counter.vcd)
*VCD file generated for analysis*
